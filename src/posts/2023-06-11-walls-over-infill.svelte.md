This is going to be a short one, but it's important because knowing this earlier on would have saved me a lot of plastic and some shipping costs. I recently discovered that increasing the number of perimeters on prints does way more for strenght than increasing infill and it does it with less material so the print weighs less too. 

I was printing nameplates and desk toys with 30% infill and 2 walls before. I started printing them with 15% infill and 4 walls. The resulting prints are much more sturdy and slightly lighter which is perfect! I've also noticed that the finish on prints like the Cinderwing3D dragons, seems to be slightly nicer. The only downside is the prints take slightly longer, but it's usually on the order of 15-30 min, which is a totally acceptable tradeoff.
