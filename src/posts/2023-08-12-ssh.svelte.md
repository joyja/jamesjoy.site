## What I've seen
Anecdotally, I see a lot of people in Industrial Automation reach for a dedicated VPN router or any manner of other proprietary solution to acheive remote access to a system. So I felt it was necessary to write a post describing what you could do generic hardware and open source software, namely: SSH. You can also thank Josh Varghese at [Traceroute](https://www.traceroutellc.com) for advocating for this post after we successfully used SSH to administer several projects. I'll also talk about a more magical and feature rich solution, [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula), later on.

## Why should I use SSH?
SSH is easier to administer, free, built-in to most operating systems, and can be made extremely reliable using a good daemon. Also, if you do it right by using token based security and manage your private keys well, it's very secure.

## Do I have it on Windows?
Yep, Microsoft now has OpenSSH built-in to the latest versions of Windows 10. It's not always enabled by default, but can easily be enabled in Add/Remove Programs using the Windows Features interface. You can find instructions on [https://learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse?tabs=gui).

You can of course also use alternative clients, like putty, but I find OpenSSH in Powershell to be far quicker to interact with.

## The Basics
The most basic use case for SSH is to access a shell command line interface on a remote server. What many people don't know, is that there is much larger functionality beyond that in SSH, but we'll get into that in a bit.

SSH requires a server and a client. Most Linux server distributions have OpenSSH already installed and enabled. Most linux desktop distributions, Mac OSX, and Windows (See above) have ssh clients. All operating systems are differnt, so if yours doesn't come with ssh built-in, you'll have research that for yours specifically.

Generally you'll start an ssh session by running this: 

```shell
ssh username@server-ip-address
```

where `username` is the name of the user on the remote system you want to log in as and `server-ip-address` is the IP address of hostname of the remote system you're trying to access.

Simple enough, right! Let's start adding some complexity and explore some of the more advanced things you can do.

## Tunneling
Your response after reading to this point may be: 

"That's all well and good James, but VPNs allow me to access services running on devices behind the VPN appliance. How does a remote shell command line interface help me do that?"

Great question, the answer is that SSH servers are able to do port forwarding! By adding a few more command line arguments you can instruct the SSH client to listen on a TCP port and forward all requests through the tunnel to a host on the other side.
