3D Printed this gnome from Flexifactory today. I love it!

I printed it on one of my Bambu X1 Carbons. I was able to reduce the waste by following [this handy guide](https://www.printables.com/model/390414-reduce-purge-waste-with-bambu-lab-ams) by Hologos. To be honest the waste savings wasn't huge, but every little bit helps and it shaved off a little bit of time too. I was able to set the Flush Volume multiplier to 0.5 and the prime volume to 20 without any color bleeding if that helps anyone who finds this post and wants something to shoot for.

This is the first thing I've printed from Flexifactory, and the way the limbs are flexible and then fit together to allow the dwarf to stand up is so satisfying. [Dan Sopola](https://www.myminifactory.com/users/FlexiFactory) is a very talented model designer.
