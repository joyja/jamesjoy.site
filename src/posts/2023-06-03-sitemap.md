I started thinking about SEO, and now that I'm on the SvelteKit train, I was curious about how to generate a dynamic sitemap. Coming from VueJS and Nuxt, I was used to having a package to handle it ([@nuxtjs/sitemap](https://sitemap.nuxtjs.org/)). It seems like in SvelteKit, it's more DIY, which I actually prefer because I'm happier with fewer dependencies at this point. I wanted an example to start from and found a great one by [Scott Spence](https://scottspence.com/posts/make-a-sitemap-with-sveltekit).

Scott is using a different SvelteKit blog template than the one I used to start this one, so mine is just a tad different, but it worked out great! The blog template this site is based on is from [Mehdi Vasigh](https://github.com/mvasigh/sveltekit-mdsvex-blog). Thanks, Mehdi!

If you want to look at the Svelte/MDsveX Blog Template Scott uses, you can head to [Matt Jennings' Github](https://github.com/mattjennings/sveltekit-blog-template). It looks excellent; the one I used just suits my needs better because I wanted something completely bare bones.
